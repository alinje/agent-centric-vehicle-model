    #(A1) obstacles may not block a road; 
    #(A2) an obstacle is detected before the vehicle gets too close to it, i.e., an obstacle may not instantly pop up right in front of the vehicle; 
    #(A3) sensing range is limited, i.e., the vehicle cannot detect an obstacle that is away from it farther than certain distance.
    #(A4) to make sure that the stay-in-lane property is achievable, we assume that an obstacle does not disappear while the vehicle is in its vicinity; 
    #(A5) obstacles may not span more than a certain number of consecutive cells in the middle of the road; 
    #(A6) each of the intersections is clear infinitely often; and 
    #(A7) each of the cells marked by star and its adjacent cells are not occupied by an obstacle infinitely often.
